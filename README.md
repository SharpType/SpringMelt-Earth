# SpringMelt-Earth

Here’s a cool twist on your typical trial font: our first-ever “video font” [Beta release](https://sharptype.co/beta/pre-release-typefaces/), which serves as a preview of our forthcoming flagship typeface, Earth. As a studio, we’ve always been interested in providing different methods for designers to use type, and for our larger audience to engage with it. 

To use this script, you must have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed. 

Before using the script please make sure the script is executable on youre command line using `chmod u+x CombineVideos.sh`
To run the script, `cd` into the Spring Melt Earth video files. 
Now all you need to do is run it by just dragging the file onto your command line and hitting enter. You will be prompted to enter a word, please only supply words that only contain A-Z, no spaces or puncuation is allowed. The tool might take a few seconds to compile all the files but you can find your output file in the same folder under `Earth-YOURWORD.mp4`
